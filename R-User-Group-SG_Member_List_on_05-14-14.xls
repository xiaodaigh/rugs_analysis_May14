I've also used it in financial econometrics as I've done some research in this field in the past, being a consultant and a former university faculty member in the Philippines.	I don't have a specific package favorite, but I'm fond of the bunch of Markov Chain Monte Carlo-related ones in CRAN. In the past years I've gravitated into the use of non-parametric and Bayesian procedures (in methodology research for example), I think this is the reason.	R (side by side with SAS probably) is my preferred software for implementing statistical and analytics procedures. I've used it very extensively in a span of applications.

If you loved programming and thrills in dating data, it's difficult not to cave in to the buzz around R in the last few years. I am not the typical formally-trained statistician, I am not even a follower of the cult of p-value. But I am who I am: a mere mortal with a passion for statistical thinking in dissecting a problem. With the thousands of packages (constantly updated) to choose from, R presents a unique, even if quirky, environment for digging into contemporary statistical analysis. My journey into R began with a somewhat potpourri of terrible fears due to the steep learning curve I've heard a zillion times, but after a few weeks of throat clearing, the relish of working in R soon relegate the fear to God's know where. I have never looked back since then. And I don't intend to.
